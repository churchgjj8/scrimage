Bound
=====

Ensures that the image is no larger than specified dimensions.

If the source image is larger, it will be scaled down, maintaining aspect ratio.

If the source image is smaller, it will be returned unmodified.

This is useful when you want to ensure images do need exceed a certain size, but you don't want to scale up if smaller.
